I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
(Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind)
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
(Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind)
They were the best times,
the harvest years with jam to lace the bread
So goodness, goodness knows why I'd throw it to the birds
But there it is, and there we are
And all I ever want to be is far from the eyes that ask me
In whose bed you're gonna be and is it true you only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind?
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind?
It's perfect as it stands, so why then crush it in your perfect hands?
(Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind)
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
So tell me, you must have thought it all out in advance
Or goodness, goodness knows why you'd throw it to the birds
You mock the good things, you play the heart strings,
Play them one by one.
But there it is, and there we are
And all I ever want to be is far from the eyes that ask me
In whose bed you gonna be and is it true you only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind?
It's perfect as it stands, so why then crush it in your perfect hands?
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind
In whose bed you gonna be and is it true you only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind?
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
It's perfect as it stands so why then crush it in your perfect hands?
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind
Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
It's perfect as it stands so why then crush it in your perfect hands?
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
